## 🔧 Local Development (Notes)

- Start the dev server with `npm run dev`. Depending on your Vite config the local URL may be `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:8080` — check the terminal output when Vite starts.
- The project previously used Supabase for dynamic content. For safety, this repository's checked-in `.env` does not contain any Supabase keys. If you need to re-enable Supabase locally, add your keys to a local `.env` (do not commit them):

```
# Example (do NOT commit):
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=public-anon-key
```

- If you do not plan to use Supabase, the app includes stubs that return empty datasets so pages will render with local/sample content.

## 📝 Notes about recent changes

- A small visual update was made to the `LogoTicker` component to remove the dark gradient overlays at the sides.
- A branch named `Updated-branch` contains these recent edits (logo ticker + safe Supabase stub and sample data). If you'd like a different branch name or a PR created for this branch, tell me and I can prepare the PR text.

If anything in this README should be expanded, or you want a brief 'Deploy to Vercel' section, tell me where and I'll add it.
